# CVML
This contains implementation of Handwritten Digit Recognition Models trained on MNIST dataset

Objective : 
  To train various classifiers/models using the following methods to classify the image sample 
  given by MNIST dataset into one of the 10 possible classes (0 to 9) :
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Multi Layer Perceptron
    3. Deep Neural Network
    4. Deep Convolutional Neural Network

Further, 
  Exercise on various parameters (if applicable) such as number of hidden layers, type of 
  activation functions, number of convolution kernels, size of convolution kernels. Also 
  exercise on over-fitting problems with possible solutions.
